# Records demo

A simple demonstration of an API developed with GraphQL, and a single page application developed with React/Redux.


## Installation

To run the backend, go to the backend directory, install dependencies with "npm install" and run:

`npm run build`   (under /backend, just once, so tsc does the initial /build)

`npm start`   (under /backend, this starts nodemon and watches for file changes)

<br /><br />

Similarly, to run the frontend, go to the frontend directory, install dependencies and run:

`npm start`   (under /frontend)

Afterwards, you can visit http://localhost:3000/ to start using the app.
